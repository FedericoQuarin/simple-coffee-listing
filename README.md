## Overview

The challenge was to build a web page based on a given picture. The only other requierement was to implement a reusable card component. The data has to be obtained from an API, and the card must adapt to the data throw some variables.
I used this challenge as a first React practice. My intention was to use all my recently adquiere knowledges about this framework in a full frontend practice.
